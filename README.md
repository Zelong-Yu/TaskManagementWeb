Introduction
------------
**Simple Scanning** is an intuitive yet powerful task management method to finish a _long list_ of tasks. The aim is to write (add) everything down that you
have to do, want to do or think you might do **without** any attempt to categorise, prioritise or emphasise any particular task in any
way. When start working, scan down the list and start working on any one task you want to work on as long as you like. If it is not finished,
cross out the original and reenter the task to the end of the list. If it is completed, simply cross it out for good. 

As time goes by, lingering uncompleted task will simply start to _stand out_ among completed tasks. Time to rethink/ reevaluate the task if 
it lingers too long.
